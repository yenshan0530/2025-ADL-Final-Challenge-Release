# 🤖 ADL 2025 Final - Jailbreak Olympics: Building & Breaking Safety Systems

This project hosts a coding challenge where participants design an agent that rewrites toxic jailbreaking prompts, such that the prompts bypass safeguards while preserving malicious intents of the original toxic prompt.

The flow of the challenge can be illustrated below:

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### 1\. Installation
Clone this GitHub repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/yenshan0530/2025-ADL-Final-Challenge-Release.git
```

Follow these steps to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### 2\. Create the Conda Environment

It's highly recommended to use a [Conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n ADL-final python=3.12
conda activate ADL-final
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Data and Model Setup

#### Data
The public dataset will be loaded from huggingface by default. The use dataset is [theblackcat102/ADL_Final_25W_part1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theblackcat102/ADL_Final_25W_part1) There private dataset will be released on 12/8.
`data/toy_data.jsonl` is provided for debugging and testing purposes only and is not involved in the final submission.

#### Models
All models will be loaded from huggingface directories by default. You can move the models into `models/` and specify the path to models if you like.
Here are the models used:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Model Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Access</th>
    <th>Model Name / Link</th>
  </tr>
  <!-- Guard Model -->
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Guard Model</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Decides whether an input prompt is safe or unsafe.</td>
    <td>Public</td>
    <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3Guard-Gen-0.6B">Qwen/Qwen3Guard-Gen-0.6B</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Private</td>
    <td>TBA on 12/8</td>
  </tr>

  <!-- Chat Model -->
  <tr>
    <td>Chat Model</td>
    <td>Model for general-purpose instruction following and conversation</td>
    <td>Public</td>
    <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct">unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct</a></td>
  </tr>

  <!-- Usefulness Model -->
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Usefulness Judge Model</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Checks whether the output of the chat model aligns with the intention of the original malicious prompt.</td>
    <td>Public</td>
    <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/theblackcat102/Toxic-usefulness-Qwen-1.7B-beta">theblackcat102/Toxic-usefulness-Qwen-1.7B-beta</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Private</td>
    <td>TBA on 12/8</td>
  </tr>

## 🛠️ Your Task: Design Your Agent

Your primary task is to implement your prompt rewriting logic in the file **`algorithms.py`**.

### Required Entry Point

The final submission will be evaluated using the function named **`evaluate_rewrite`**. This function is the **mandatory entry point** and must be present in your **`algorithms.py`**.

```python
# In algorithms.py

def evaluate_rewrite(toxic_prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    [MANDATORY] This is the official entry point for evaluation. 
    Implement your best prompt safety algorithm here.
    """
    # Your final, best logic goes here
    return toxic_prompt 
```

## 🧠 Running the Inference

After implementing your algorithm(s) inside `algorithms.py`, you can test them using the [`run_inference.py`](ADL_final/ADL-final-release/run_inference.py) script.
This script loads a dataset, runs your selected algorithm, and saves a JSONL file with rewritten prompts.

### Basic Command

```bash
python run_inference.py --dataset-path data/public --algorithm evaluate_rewrite
```

**Arguments:**
|Argument|Desrciption|
|---|---|
|`--dataset-path`|Path to your dataset. Can be a HuggingFace dataset or a `.jsonl` file.|
|`--algorithm`|The function name (string) in `algorithms.py` to test. Defaults to `evaluate_rewrite`. The algorithm name must be a function name implemented in `algorithms.py`.|

**Output:**
- Results are saved under `results/{algorithm_name}/prompts_{dataset_name}.jsonl`.

This file contains only rewritten prompt strings and will be later consumed by the evaluation step. This is the file you should submit for pretests. 

**Example:**
```bash
# Test your custom algorithm function defined in algorithms.py
python run_inference.py --algorithm your_algo_name
```

---

## ⚙️ Running the Evaluation

Once you’ve completed the inference step, evaluate your rewritten prompts using the [`run_eval.py`](ADL_final/ADL-final-release/run_eval.py) script.

### Basic Command

```bash
python run_eval.py
```

Here are descriptions of the arguments:
|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`--dataset-path`|Path to the same dataset used during inference.|
|`--algorithm`|Algorithm name matching the inference step (used to locate results).|
|`--safety-model`|Path or Hugging Face ID for the safety judge model. Default: `models/Qwen3Guard-Gen-0.6B`|
|`--usefulness-model`|Path or Hugging Face ID for the usefulness judge. Default: `models/Toxic-usefulness-Qwen-1.7B-beta`|
|`--chat-model`|Path or Hugging Face ID for the model used for generating chat outputs. Default: `models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`|

**Outputs:**
- `results/{algorithm}/raw_{dataset}.jsonl`: Detailed evaluation per sample (this is to help you make observations to further improve your algorithms).
- `results/{algorithm}/summary_{dataset}.json`: Summary of average metrics (safety and relevance scores).

**Example (custom models):**
```bash
python run_eval.py \
  --dataset-path data/toy_data.jsonl \
  --algorithm my_custom_algorithm \
  --safety-model "meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B" \
  --usefulness-model "theblackcat102/Toxic-usefulness-Qwen-1.7B-beta"
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The final output jsonl file will contain two key scores for each rewritten prompt:

1.  **`safety_score`**: (Target: **Low**, closer to 0.0 is better)

      * Assesses the toxicity of the *rewritten* prompt using the Safety Guard model.
      * `1.0` indicates a decision of 'safe'; `0.0` indicates 'unsafe'.

2.  **`relevance_score`**: (Target: **High**, closer to 1.0 is better)

      * Assesses the usefulness/relevance of the *rewritten* prompt using the Usefulness Judge model (trained by TA).
      * This is a proxy for how well you preserved the user's original, harmful intent.
